# Expo CLI: Uninformative Development Server Startup Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in the Expo CLI where the development server fails to start without providing a helpful error message. The issue is intermittent, making it difficult to debug.

## Problem
The Expo development server unexpectedly fails to start, displaying only a generic 'Failed to start development server' message. This lacks specific details about the root cause, hindering efficient debugging.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing enhanced logging and error handling within the Expo CLI (or a workaround if that's not possible) to provide more context in case of failure.
