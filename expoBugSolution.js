The ideal solution would involve enhancing the Expo CLI to provide more detailed error messages.  Since direct modification of the Expo CLI isn't feasible for most users, a practical workaround might involve:

1. **Running the project in a different environment:** Sometimes, conflicts within the developer's environment can cause such failures. Trying to run the project on a different machine or using a fresh virtual machine might isolate the issue.

2. **Checking for conflicting packages:** Ensure that there are no conflicting packages in the `package.json` that might clash with Expo's dependencies. Review all packages and confirm there are no incompatible versions.

3. **Reviewing network configuration:**  Network connectivity issues can sometimes disrupt the Expo development server. Checking the local network and firewall settings might resolve the issue.

4. **Cleaning the project:** Removing the `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock` (or `package-lock.json`) and reinstalling dependencies can resolve various dependency-related conflicts.

5. **Detailed logging (if possible):** If you have access to the Expo CLI source, adding extra logging statements around the development server start-up logic can provide clues.

Example (illustrative, needs adaptation to the actual Expo CLI code):

```javascript
// Hypothetical Expo CLI code snippet (for illustrative purposes only)
const startServer = async () => {
  try {
    console.log('Attempting to start the development server...');
    // ... (Expo's development server start-up logic)
    console.log('Development server started successfully.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to start development server:', error); // More detailed error reporting
    console.error('Stack trace:', error.stack); // Include the stack trace for analysis
  }
};
```
